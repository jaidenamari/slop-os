# Specs

This directory contains implementation plans generated by `/quick-plan` and `/plan` commands.

## Naming Convention

Files are named in kebab-case based on the feature: `{feature-name}.md`

Example: `user-dashboard-chart.md`

## Generated By

- `/quick-plan [description]`
- `/plan [description]`

## Used By

- `/build specs/{spec-file}.md` - Implements the spec
- `@review-agent` - Validates implementation against spec

## Lifecycle

1. User runs `/quick-plan` → spec created here
2. User runs `/build specs/...` → implementation
3. Review validates against spec
4. Spec can be archived or deleted after feature ships
